# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
This repository contains the code and experiments for the "LLM - Detect AI Generated Text" Kaggle competition using a Naive Bayes Classifier.

## Kaggle Notebooks

All the experiments and model training were conducted on Kaggle. You can find the Kaggle notebook in the following links:  

 Both notebooks share the same foundational code logic.  
1. [My Kaggle notebook1 - Initial.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vinodpgowda/initial)
The first notebook has been successfully submitted on Kaggle, achieving a satisfactory test accuracy.

3. [My Kaggle notebook2 - Updated.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vinodpgowda/updated)
The second notebook was utilized for experimentation and addressing other sub-queries related to the given task.

## Kaggle Results

The results of the experiments, including validation accuracies and decisions on hyperparameters, are documented in the Kaggle notebooks.

## Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Petals to the Metal" Kaggle competition dataset. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data).
